# 📈 Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

This project demonstrates how to forecast sales data using time series modeling techniques in Python. Implemented on Google Colab as part of my learning in data science and forecasting.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a model that can **predict future sales** based on historical data. This is a common use-case in retail and business analytics for planning and strategy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib 
- Scikit-learn
- Linear Regression

---

## 📊 Dataset

- File: `SALES.xlsx`
- Description: Contains historical sales records (e.g., monthly/weekly/daily).
  
---

## 🔍 Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized trends, seasonality, and noise in the sales data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and ensured the data was time-indexed.
3. **Modeling**
   - Applied Linear Regression model 
4. **Evaluation**
   - Used metrics like MAE, RMSE to assess model performance.
5. **Forecasting**
   - Generated future sales predictions and visualized the results.

## 📌 Results

- The model was able to capture the general trend and provide reasonably accurate forecasts.
- Example plot of actual vs predicted sales:
